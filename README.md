## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ (for Firebase CLI)
- Firebase account
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ExamProject
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**
   - Create a new Firebase project
   - Enable Authentication and Firestore
   - Copy your Firebase config to `js/firebase.js`
   - Deploy security rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`

4. **Local Development**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser

### Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**
   - `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `FIREBASE_APP_ID`

## 🧠 DSA Matching Algorithm

The platform implements a sophisticated greedy matching algorithm that:

1. **Filters products** by category, price range, and condition
2. **Scores products** based on:
   - Keyword relevance (title, description, keywords)
   - Price optimization within budget
   - Product condition preference
   - Seller rating and recency
3. **Ranks results** using greedy selection for optimal matches
4. **Provides confidence scores** and detailed match explanations

### Algorithm Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) where n is the number of products
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing filtered and scored products
- **Optimization**: Greedy approach ensures fast, near-optimal results

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Role-based access control** for all data operations
- **Firestore security rules** preventing unauthorized access
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Secure authentication** with Firebase Auth
- **Data encryption** in transit and at rest

## 📊 Admin Features

## 🔧 Configuration

### Firebase Configuration
Update `js/firebase.js` with your Firebase project credentials:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
  appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### Environment Variables
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:
- `FIREBASE_API_KEY`
- `FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
- `FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID`
